According to recent events in Iran due to the murdered 22-year-old girl called [__Mahsa Amini__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Mahsa_Amini), her name has been a trend on social media platforms like Twitter(__#MahsaAmini #مهسا_امینی__). She died on September 16, 2022, and since then, many protests have been held in Iran.
We are supposed to collect the data on Twitter related to her and analyze the data.

There are many packages(in pip) to collect the data from Twitter but, I have used the pure one which uses the Curl to send and receive the requests and responces. However, for all apps, we need to have Twitter API Key which you can get it for different puposes(which means with different licences). The API key can be registered on [Twitter Developer](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard).

There are some restrictions on Twitter API so that, we cannot retrieve any data from it. Basically, it depends on the license that we have from Twitter. For example if we want to search on tweets based on any phrase or hashtag, we have a limitation of 300 requests per 15 minutes and in each request we will get maximum of 100 results(tweets). Overall, we have a limitation on total number of tweets per month.
